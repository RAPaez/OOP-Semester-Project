# OOP-Semester-Project
For my Object Oriented Program class at St. Mary's University

I want to create a basic flashcard system. Add folders, add flashcards to folders. Then a basic study session that goes over flashcards in a folder, or by user choice. Then move on to more advanced memory techniques - such as those given on the website https://maestrolearning.com/blogs/how-to-use-spaced-repetition/ where they go over the Piotr Wozniak’s revolutionary SuperMemo (SM-2) system, the Sebastian Leitner’s bare-bones Leitner system, and the Pimsleur’s effective language-learning method.

Of course the method used will depend what the user wants to memorize - as the language learning method I'd assume would be better for learning languages while the Piotr Wozniak's method would be a more general memorization method. Sebastian Leitner's method I would like to try implementing a variable timeline that would depend on the user. 

In the future I would also like to add a grading system assinged to each flashcard - and a data report to the user on which cards are the toughest and reccommended study methods and techniques to ensure recall. 

I would also like to add a notification system that would notify the user to study the flashcards - with the user able to enter a good time each day to get a notification to study - or a intuitive notification system like Duolingo has - that finds the optimal time to notify the user to study. I heard that it just notifys based on when the user studied the day before - if they could study yesterday at that time chances are they can study today at that time, which I can also implement.
